# Conway's Game of Life

**Conway's Game of Life** is a zero-player cellular automaton devised by mathematician **John Conway** in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that evolve through generations based on a set of simple rules. Each cell can be in one of two states: _alive_ or _dead_, and the state of each cell in the next generation is determined by the states of its eight neighbors.

Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life is Turing-complete and capable of simulating any algorithm. It is widely studied in computer science, mathematics, and complexity theory.

## Glider Pattern

A **glider** is one of the most well-known patterns in Conway's Game of Life. It is a configuration of five live cells that moves diagonally across the grid. The glider cycles through four generations and reappears in its original form, shifted one cell diagonally.

Because of this behavior, gliders are often used to transmit information or signals across the board and are fundamental components in building logical circuits and computational systems within the Game of Life universe.
